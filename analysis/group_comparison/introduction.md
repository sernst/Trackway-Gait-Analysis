# Generated Parameter Space Analysis

This is the results of an analysis of simulated data that ranges over the 
variables:

 * __Limb Phase__: The relative phases of each limb in the quadruped, which 
 defines the gait. A value of 0% is a pace, 90% an ambul, 180% a trot and
 270% a walk.
 
 * __Duty Cycle__: The relative amount of time each foot spends on the ground
 versus in transition to its next position during the cycle of the gait. A value
 of 50% (0.5) indicates that half of the time is spent fixed and half the time
 in transition. A value of 70% (0.7) would indicate that 70% of the time fixed 
 and only 30% of the time in transition.
 
 * __Print Interval__: The linear distance between successive manus and pes 
 prints. A print interval of 0 indicates that the manus and pes prints overlap.
 A value of 50% indicates that the manus prints are located halfway between
 successive pes prints.
